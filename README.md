## Brief description

Sentiment analysis of social media data, especially Twitter, has gained significant attention in recent 
years due to the abundance of user-generated content and its potential for understanding public opinion and 
sentiment trends. In this project, we aim to develop an effective sentiment analysis system for Twitter data, 
focusing on classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. We explored various machine learning 
techniques, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest 
Neighbours (KNN), to accomplish this task. The performance of each model is evaluated based on their accuracy 
in sentiment classification. Through our investigation, we identify the strengths and limitations of each model and 
provide insights into their suitability for sentiment analysis in Twitter data. The findings of this project contribute 
to the broader field of sentiment analysis and provide practical implications for understanding and analyzing 
sentiments expressed on Twitter. According to studies, Twitter acts as a content aggregator, driving specific 
trends to popularity.
